# Online-Event-Management-System
In the current situation everything is changed to online mode, from work to studies and many
others. So also the events organized are mostly in online mode. So its very important to plan
for event before organizing it. Planning includes the place and number of volunteers required,
the number of participants willing to join or maximum number of persons can be participated
and fixing a date for the event based on the free times of everyone.We have attached a calendar
to the web api so that students can select a set of users. And another major problem in online
registration of events are the fake accounts which blocks the seats, so that the original
registration decreases, so we have tried to authenticate the users and eradicate the fake accounts
from the registration list. And the Admin can be able to select the users who can join event or
not.
